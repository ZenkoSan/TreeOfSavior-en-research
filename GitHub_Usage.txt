	GitHub Usage Guide
	
This is Ensata's basic guide to not ruining other people's contributions to GitHub.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
	
	Always write a summary. 
		Mention the section you reviewed in the commit title for fast reference.
		Explain the types of edits performed in the summary.
		Definitely explain your edit if you're doing a mass search and replace.
	
	Edit lines in groups. 
		Limit your range as much as possible to avoid potential merge conflicts.
		For example, edit a specific area of 100 lines, from lines 1-100, or 2101-2200, etc.

	Do not edit more than ~300 lines in a file in a single commit/pull request. 
		GitHub will not display a diff inside the browser if it exceeds 100 KB.
		The 100 KB limit can average at ~300 lines, but will be larger or smaller depending on the edits made.
	
	Github will not render tsv files as a searchable table if:
		The file is larger than 512kb
		Quotation marks are not formatted correctly (This is difficult to avoid! See the Style Guide!)
