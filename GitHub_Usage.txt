	GitHub Usage Guide
	
This is Ensata's basic guide to not ruining other people's contributions to GitHub.

Most of this is rudimentary stuff for any kind of collaborative writing program.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
	
	Tell us what you're doing. Write an edit summary. 
		Say what/where you edited in commit title for fast reference. Keep it short.
		Explain the types of edits in the summary, and why. ie. punctuation; translation; mass replacement
	
	Don't edit randomly. Aim for something specific. 
		ie. submit things that modify a specific part of the file, ie. lines 1-100, or 2101-2200, etc.
		ie. submit things that modify a specific part of the game, ie. Map Menu, one Sidequest, etc
		
	Keep your submissions small. Cluster your edits.
		Limit your size and range as much as possible to avoid potential merge conflicts.
		Separate the types of edits and make multiple submissions.
	
Specific to GitHub:
	
	Don't edit more than ~300 lines in a file in a single commit/pull request. 
		Tracking changes becomes much more difficult if a submission exceeds 100 KB.
		The 100 KB limit can average at ~300 edited lines, but will be larger or smaller depending on the edits.
	
	Github will not render tsv files as a searchable table if:
		The file is larger than 512kb
		Quotation marks are not formatted correctly (This is difficult to avoid! See the Style Guide!)
